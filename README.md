## Radio  
  
I'll put accumulated radio related stuff in here (minus small one off code, which will probably end up in the "wireless_tools" repo).  
  
I am intending this to mostly be a collection of information on radio types and antennas and such.
  
Files ending in `.org` are Emacs Orgmode files.  Any modern copy of Emacs should be able to open them with the proper format.  They will look a bit strange on here because there is some cross over between Orgmode structure and the markdown used for Github.
